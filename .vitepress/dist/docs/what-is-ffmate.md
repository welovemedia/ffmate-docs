# What is FFmate?

**FFmate is not just another media processing server, it’s a powerful extension of FFmpeg that makes it more accessible, automated, and feature-rich.**

While FFmpeg is an incredible media toolkit, it lacks essential capabilities like queue management, a REST API, watchfolder monitoring, out-of-the-box presets, webhook notifications, and a user-friendly interface.

FFmate fills these gaps, bringing FFmpeg’s full power to developers, workflow engineers, and non-technical users alike.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Queueing System** – Submit and manage multiple concurrent FFmpeg jobs efficiently.
* **Dynamic Filename Wildcards** – Enable smart and customizable output file naming.
* **Webhook Notifications** – Receive real-time updates for seamless integration with external workflows.
* **Watchfolder** – Automatically detect and process new files as they appear.
* **Pre & Post Processing Actions** – Execute custom commands or scripts before and after transcoding.
* **Preconfigured Presets** – Simplify common media conversion tasks with ready-to-use settings.
* **Web UI** – Monitor and configure transcoding workflows with an intuitive interface.

## 📌 Use Cases

### 📽️ Automated media transcoding

Convert videos, extract audio, or generate thumbnails with minimal setup.

## ⚙️ Workflow & Pipeline automation

Webhooks provide real-time notifications for seamless integration with:

* **Internal pipeline tooling**
* **Media asset management systems**
* **Cloud workflows**

### ☁️ Scalable FFmpeg API Backend

Deploy FFmate as a centralized transcoding service with intelligent job management.
