# Understanding Tasks in FFmate

In FFmate, a **task** is an individual FFmpeg job, whether it's transcoding, extracting audio, or applying filters. Tasks can be submitted **individually** or as part of a **batch**, allowing multiple files to be processed efficiently in a single request. Every task follows a structured **lifecycle**, progressing from submission to execution and ultimately reaching completion or failure.

Let's start by exploring how **single** tasks work.

## üìù Creating a Task

To create a task, send a `POST` request to the FFmate API:

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/tasks \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "command": "-y -i ${INPUT_FILE} -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 ${OUTPUT_FILE}",
       "inputFile": "videos/input.mp4",
       "outputFile": "videos/output.mp4",
       "priority": 2
     }'
```

### üìå Task Properties

- **`command`** *[mandatory]*

Defines the FFmpeg command to execute. FFmate **implicitly calls the FFmpeg binary**, so you only need to specify the **command-line parameters and flags**, without including `ffmpeg` itself.

- **`inputFile`** *[optional]* ‚Äì The path to the input media file that will be processed..

- **`outputFile`** *[optional]* ‚Äì The path where the transcoded file should be saved.

::: tip Handling Input and Output Files

- The **`inputFile`** and **`outputFile`** properties are **optional** and should only be used if your command includes the placeholders `${INPUT_FILE}` and `${OUTPUT_FILE}`.
- FFmate **automatically replaces** these placeholders with the actual file paths during execution.
- If your command **directly specifies input and output paths**, you do **not** need to provide these properties separately.
:::

- **`priority`** *[mandatory]* ‚Äì Determines the execution order:
  - `1` ‚Üí Low priority
  - `2` ‚Üí Normal priority (default)
  - `3` ‚Üí High priority
  - `4` ‚Üí Critical priority (executed first)

After submitting a task, FFmate will respond with a JSON object containing the `taskId`. This `taskId` can be used to monitor the task‚Äôs progress in the next section.

---

## üîç Monitoring a Task

Once submitted, you can check a task‚Äôs status by making a `GET` request:

```sh
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://localhost:3000/api/v1/tasks/{taskId}' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

Replace `{taskId}` with the actual task ID from the submission response.

### Example Response:

```json
{
  "batch": "string",
  "command": {
    "raw": "string",
    "resolved": "string"
  },
  "createdAt": 0,
  "error": "string",
  "finishedAt": 0,
  "inputFile": {
    "raw": "string",
    "resolved": "string"
  },
  "name": "string",
  "outputFile": {
    "raw": "string",
    "resolved": "string"
  },
  "postProcessing": {
    "error": "string",
    "finishedAt": 0,
    "scriptPath": {
      "raw": "string",
      "resolved": "string"
    },
    "sidecarPath": {
      "raw": "string",
      "resolved": "string"
    },
    "startedAt": 0
  },
  "preProcessing": {
    "error": "string",
    "finishedAt": 0,
    "scriptPath": {
      "raw": "string",
      "resolved": "string"
    },
    "sidecarPath": {
      "raw": "string",
      "resolved": "string"
    },
    "startedAt": 0
  },
  "priority": 0,
  "progress": 0,
  "source": "string",
  "startedAt": 0,
  "status": "QUEUED",
  "updatedAt": 0,
  "uuid": "string"
}
```

## üîç Monitoring All Tasks

FFmate allows you to retrieve a list of all tasks, regardless of their current state‚Äîwhether they are waiting in the queue, actively processing, successfully completed, or encountered an error.

To retrieve a list of all tasks, send a GET request to the API:

```sh
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://localhost:3000/api/v1/tasks?page=0&perPage=100' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

**Query Parameters:**

- **`page`** *[optional]* ‚Äì Specifies which page of results to retrieve. Default: `0`.
- **`perPage`** *[optional]* ‚Äì Defines how many tasks should be included in each page. Default: `100`.

---

## üõë Canceling a Task

FFmate allows you to cancel a task that is currently **queued** or **processing**. Once canceled, the task will not be executed or will be stopped if already in progress.

To cancel a task, make a `PATCH` request:

```sh
curl -X 'PATCH' \
  'http://localhost:3000/api/v1/tasks/{taskId}/cancel' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

**Query Parameters:**

- **`{taskId}`** *[mandatory]* ‚Äì Specifies unique ID of the task you want to cancel.

<div class="tip custom-block" style="padding-top: 8px">
note
If the task is already processing, FFmate will attempt to **stop** it, but cancellation may not always be immediate.
</div>

## ‚è≥ Task Lifecycle & Statuses

Each task progresses through different states:

| Status       | Description                                         |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `queued`     | The task is waiting to be processed.               |
| `processing` | The task is currently being executed by FFmpeg.   |
| `completed`  | The task has finished successfully.               |
| `failed`     | The task encountered an error during execution.   |
| `canceled`   | The task was manually canceled before completion. |

### Task Flow:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    queued -->|Starts processing| processing;
    processing -->|Finishes successfully| completed;
    processing -->|Fails| failed;
    queued -->|Canceled| canceled;
```

---

## ‚úã Cancelling a Task

To cancel a task before it finishes:

```sh
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/api/v1/tasks/{taskId}/cancel
```

This works for **queued** and **processing** tasks.

---

## üóëÔ∏è Deleting a Task

Once a task is completed or canceled, you can delete it:

```sh
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/v1/tasks/{taskId}
```

**Note:** Deleting a task **does not** remove its input/output files.
