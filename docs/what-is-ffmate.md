# What is FFmate?

**FFmate is a modern and powerful automation layer built on top of [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)—designed to make video and audio transcoding simpler, smarter, and easier to integrate.**


While `FFmpeg` is the industry standard for media encoding and conversion, it can be complex to use directly—especially at scale.  

With FFmate, you get all the raw power of `FFmpeg`—plus the tools you need to automate, monitor, and scale your workflows with ease.

Whether you’re a developer building a media pipeline, a workflow engineer managing a farm of agents, or a non-technical user needing simple batch conversions, FFmate is designed to work for you.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Queueing System** – Submit and manage multiple concurrent `FFmpeg` jobs efficiently.
- **Cluster Support** – Run multiple FFmate instances together, sharing the same database for scaling and redundancy.
- **Dynamic Filename Wildcards** – Enable smart and customizable output file naming.
- **Webhook Notifications** – Receive real-time updates for seamless integration with external workflows.
- **Watchfolder** – Automatically detect and process new files as they appear.
- **Pre & Post Processing Actions** – Execute custom commands or scripts before and after transcoding.
- **Preconfigured Presets** – Simplify common media conversion tasks with ready-to-use settings.
- **Web UI** – Monitor and configure transcoding workflows with an intuitive interface.

## 📌 Use Cases

### 📽️ Automated Media Transcoding  

Easily automate common media processing tasks like video conversion, audio extraction, and thumbnail generation.  
FFmate allows you to submit multiple `FFmpeg` jobs at once and handles them efficiently through a built-in queueing system.  
Perfect for post-production pipelines, cloud workflows, or any scenario where repetitive transcoding needs to be streamlined.


### ⚙️ Workflow & Pipeline Automation  

Use FFmate’s webhook system to sync with:

- Internal automation tools  
- Media asset management (MAM) platforms  
- Cloud-based production or publishing workflows  

No polling required—just plug in your endpoint and go.

### ☁️ Scalable FFmpeg Job Management  

Run FFmate as a centralized, API-first backend for `FFmpeg` job orchestration.  
You can scale the number of **simultaneous jobs** based on available resources—without needing to manage multiple agents.  
With full control over job priority, queuing, and task lifecycle, FFmate is ideal for high-volume transcoding environments where reliability and automation matter.

Use it to power:

- Cloud-based encoding workflows.  
- Media conversion microservices.
- Internal development tools that need `FFmpeg` processing on demand.


### 🗂️ Drop Folder Ingest (Watchfolder)  

Set up a watchfolder to automatically detect new files and trigger predefined processing workflows—perfect for camera card offloads, shared storage, or ingest pipelines.
