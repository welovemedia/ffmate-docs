# Watchfolders

**Watchfolders** in FFmate allow you to automatically detect and process new files in a specified directory.

Once a watchfolder is configured, FFmate will **continuously scan** the folder for new or modified files and create **tasks** to process them based on a task preset. 

The watchfolder feature is useful for **automatically transcoding** footage from a camera SD card dropped into a network share or creating low-resolution versions of high-resolution files exported from an NLE for review.

## How Watchfolders Work

1. **Monitor a Folder** â€“ FFmate scans the specified directory at a **set interval** to watch for new files.  
2. **Detect New Files** â€“ When a new file appears, FFmate doesnâ€™t process it immediately. Instead, it checks the fileâ€™s **size** over time.  
   - If the size continues to change, the file is still being copied or written.  
   - If the size remains the same for a number of consecutive checks (controlled by the `growthChecks` setting), FFmate considers the file as finished and creates a task for it.  

    By waiting until the file stops growing, FFmate ensures that partially copied or incomplete files arenâ€™t processed too early. This is especially important for large media files being uploaded over a network or transferred from external systems.

3. **Create Tasks** â€“ Each finished file results in a **new [task](/docs/tasks.md)** that FFmate processes automatically.

    For each processed file, FFmate creates an empty `.lock` file next to it (e.g., `movie.mp4` â†’ `movie.mp4.lock`).
    
    This special file ensures the file isnâ€™t picked up again, even after a restart. If the `.lock` file is removed while the original is still in the folder, the watchfolder will see it as new and process it again.

### Watchfolder metadata

Tasks created by a watchfolder always include a specific `metadata` object populated with file information about the item that triggered the task. This includes:  

- `path` â€” the absolute path to the watchfolder  
- `relativeDir` â€” the relative directory of the file inside the watchfolder  
- `relativePath` â€” the relative path to the file inside the watchfolder  
- `uuid` â€” the unique identifier of the watchfolder that generated the task

Example:  

```json
"metadata": {
  "ffmate": {
    "watchfolder": {
      "path": "/volumes/ffmate/wf",
      "relativeDir": "parent/subfolder1",
      "relativePath": "parent/subfolder1/18moo.mov",
      "uuid": "06bbbe21-8003-41b3-94f4-62508486c482"
    }
  }
}
```

## Creating a Watchfolder  

To create a watchfolder, send a `POST` request to the FFmate API:

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/watchfolders \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "name": "Camera Card Watch",
       "description": "Automatically processes camera footage",
       "interval": 10,
       "growthChecks": 3,
       "preset": "cabfad2c-70d1-4df6-9267-f549a376301f",
       "path": "/volumes/media/camera_cards",
       "suspended": false
       "filter": {
         "extensions": {
           "exclude": ["tmp", "log"]
         }
       }
     }'
```

After you create a preset, FFmate responds with a JSON object that includes the `ID` of the newly created watchfolder. A `watchfolder.created` event is also fired via [webhooks](/docs/webhooks#watchfolder-events)

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Creating a new preset? You can define and save presets directly in the [FFmate Web UI](/docs/web-ui.md) without writing any API requests

## Watchfolder Properties

- **`name`** â€“ A unique name for the watchfolder.  
- **`description`** â€“ Optional description of what this watchfolder does.  
- **`interval`** â€“ How often (in seconds) FFmate scans the folder for new files.  
- **`growthChecks`** â€“ The number of checks FFmate performs to ensure a file is fully copied before processing.  
- **`preset`** â€“ The ID of a predefined transcoding **preset** that will be applied to detected files.  
- **`path`** â€“ The **absolute path** of the directory to monitor.  
- **`suspended`** â€“ A boolean flag that pauses watchfolder scanning. When set to `true`, FFmate temporarily stops detecting and processing files in the folder.
- **`filter`** â€“ Rules for file selection:  
  - **`include`** â€“ Only process files with these extensions (e.g., `mp4`, `mov`).  
  - **`exclude`** â€“ Ignore files with these extensions (e.g., `tmp`, `log`).  

::: tip How filters work  
FFmate always checks the `exclude` list **first**.  
If a fileâ€™s extension matches anything in `exclude`, the file will be skippedâ€”**even if it also matches an extension in `include`**.

To keep things simple and predictable, it's best to use **either** `include` or `exclude`, not both at the same time.

## Listing Watchfolders  

Send a `GET` request to the FFmate API to list all configured watchfolders.

```sh
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:3000/api/v1/watchfolders?page=0&perPage=10'
```

FFmate rreturns a JSON array containing all configured watchfolders. The `X-Total` response headers provides the total number of presets available.

**Query Parameters:**

- **`page`** *[optional]* â€“ Specifies which page of results to retrieve. Default: `0`.
- **`perPage`** *[optional]* â€“ Defines how many watchfolders should be included in each page. Default: `100`.

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Need an overview of all watchfolders? You can browse and manage them easily in the [FFmate Web UI](/docs/web-ui.md).

## Getting a Single Watchfolder

To retrieve the details of a specific watchfolder, send a `GET` request to the FFmate API, including the watchfolder's `ID` in the path.

```sh
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/watchfolders/{watchfolderId}
```

FFmate responds with a JSON object containing the full details of the specified watchfolder.

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Want a quick way to check the watchfolder details? You can view watchfolder configurations directly in the [FFmate Web UI](/docs/web-ui.md) without using the API.

## Updating a Watchfolder

You can update an existing watchfolder's configuration by sending a `PUT` request to the FFmate API, including the watchfolder's `ID` in the path. The request body should contain the complete, updated definition of the watchfolder. You can find a list of all available properties in the [Watchfolder Properties](#watchfolder-properties) section above.

```sh
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/v1/watchfolders/{watchfolderId} \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "name": "Camera Card Watch",
       "description": "Processes high-res camera footage",
       "interval": 15,
       "growthChecks": 5,
       "preset": "uuid-of-updated-preset",
       "path": "/volumes/media/camera_cards_archive",
       "suspended": false
       "filter": {
         "extensions": {
           "include": ["mov", "mp4", "mxf"]
         }
       }
     }'
```

FFmate responds with the full JSON object representing the updated watchfolder. The watchfolder will restart with the new configuration shortly after the update. A `watchfolder.updated` event is also fired via [webhooks](/docs/webhooks#watchfolder-events)

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Making changes to a watchfolder? You can update settings like filters and intervals directly in the [FFmate Web UI](/docs/web-ui.md).

## Suspending a Watchfolder

The `suspended` flag lets you temporarily stop FFmate from detecting and processing files in a watchfolder. This is especially useful in production environments when you need to pause file processing during ingest operations, workflow changes, system maintenance. It also enables external applications or schedulers to programmatically start or stop a watchfolder as needed.

To suspend a watchfolder, send a `PUT` request to the FFmate API with the watchfolderâ€™s `ID` in the path and the `suspended` flag set to `true`.  
For example:

```sh
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/v1/watchfolders/{watchfolderId} \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "name": "Camera Card Watch",
       "description": "Processes high-res camera footage",
       "interval": 15,
       "growthChecks": 5,
       "preset": "uuid-of-updated-preset",
       "path": "/volumes/media/camera_cards_archive",
       "suspended": true
       "filter": {
         "extensions": {
           "include": ["mov", "mp4", "mxf"]
         }
       }
     }'
```

FFmate responds with the full JSON object representing the updated watchfolder. When `suspended` is set to `true`, FFmate temporarily halts scanning and file processing in that folder. 

To resume scanning, send another `PUT` request with `suspended` set to `false`. Updating the `suspended` state counts as a watchfolder update, so it will also trigger a `watchfolder.updated` via [webhooks](/docs/webhooks#watchfolder-events).

ðŸ’¡ Tip: You can also suspend and resume watchfolder scanning directly in the [FFmate Web UI](/docs/web-ui.md).

## Deleting a Watchfolder 

Send a `DELETE` request to the FFmate API to remove a watchfolder by including the watchfolder's `ID` in the path.

```sh
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/v1/watchfolders/{watchfolderId} \
     -H "accept: application/json"
```

 FFmate responds with a `204` No Content status. The watchfolder will be **removed** from the system, and any monitoring for that folder will **stop**. A `watchfolder.deleted` event is also fired via [webhooks](/docs/webhooks#watchfolder-events)

ðŸ’¡ Tip: No need to send a delete request manuallyâ€”you can remove watchfolders instantly from the [FFmate Web UI](/docs/web-ui.md).
